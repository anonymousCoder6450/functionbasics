#Welcome to the first example, functions have 3 distinct things that need to be filled in, Our name, parameters and arguments. 

def func(x):
  return x + 5
#So in this function it's quite small, functions are able to be reused for other pieces of code and I like to think of it like a black box
#Where you have an input, the process and then the output. For this function we start of with a "def" this tells our IDE/text editor that 
# we're defining a new function (hence the name def), we then have our name which is orange which can be ANYTHING, I recommend you make it lowercase
#as it's easier and it won't error when creating VERY big programs as well as not to nate it "range" "input" or any name that's already a function
#in python, the IDE will mix both up at one point and your code will eventually mix up and you will get mixed up

#Now moving on, our return in the function is called a return statement, in functions 99.9% of the time you'll have a return statement that actually returns something
#if you don't include a return statement it'll just print "None" in the terminal
#Here try this code out and see
def func1(x)
  if x == 6
  return "Hello World"

# you notice how you dont need to include the brackets liek you do for the print function which makes it way more clean in your code.

#In summary functions are blocks of code that can be used anywhere in your code as many times as possible, 
#This is a very simplified explanation of function and I will make a more complex one in the future
